        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A cheap, but pretty disguting meal, for people who can't be bothered to cook</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your favorite brand of instant noodles</li>
            <li>1 pack of spices, included in the pack of noodles</li>
            <li>1 pack of dehydrated vegetables, included in the pack of noodles</li>
            <li>Grated cheese (optionnal)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the pack of noodles. Add boiling water up to the line.</li>
            <li>Add the spices. Discard the pack of dehydrated veggies, cause that's just gross.</li>
            <li>Cover the noodles for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>If you are feeling fancy, add grated cheese to the noodles once they are cooked. We do not recommend you do this.</li>
            <li>Relive your student days and enjoy!</li>
